Inductive day : Type :=
  | monday : day

  | wednesday : day
  | thursday : day
  | friday : day 
  | saturday : day
  | sunday : day.

(** The new type is called day, and its members are monday, tuesday, etc.
Having defined day, we can write functions that operate on days.**)

Definition next_weekday (d:day) : day :=
  match d with
  | monday    => tuesday
  | tuesday   => wednesday
  | wednesday => thursday
  | thursday  => friday
  | friday    => monday
  | saturday  => monday
  | sunday    => monday
  end.

(*Compute (next_weekday friday).
Compute (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)).*)
(* ==> tuesday : day *)

(*Example test_next_weekday:
  (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)) = tuesday.
